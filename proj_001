# Motor Trend. The relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon  research.

## Introduction
You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

Q1. “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
Q2. "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

## Exploratory data analysis
The data contains Motor Trend Car Road Tests and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models). 

A data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.

[mpg]   Miles/(US) gallon
[cyl]	 Number of cylinders
[disp]	 Displacement (cu.in.)
[hp]	 Gross horsepower
[drat]	 Rear axle ratio
[wt]	 Weight (lb/1000)
[qsec]	 1/4 mile time
[vs]	 V/S
[am]	 Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
[gear]	 Number of forward gears
[carb]	 Number of carburetors

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Start of the analysis
The result of the analysis is to answer on 2 questions mentioned in the introduction. 
To find out the relation between an automatic/manual transmission with fuel consumption (Q1) we can use [am] (see data analysis) as predictor and [mpg] as outcome and fit a linear model.
First we need to understand what really influences on mpg:

the correlation between these normalized data sets
cor(gpa_nor,gch_nor)
# How does this correlation relate to the correlation of the unnormalized data?
#It is the same.




## Coefficients interpretation
```{r}
mpg <- mtcars$mpg
am  <- mtcars$am

fit <- lm(mpg ~ am)
summary(fit)
coef(summary(fit))
```

```{r}
coef(summary(fit))[2]
``` 
The slope of the line is the estimate of the coefficient, or muliplier, of "transmission type", the independent variable of our data  (in this case, the transmission type)

```{r}
coef(summary(fit))[2] # The slope of the line is the estimate of the coefficient, or muliplier, of "transmission type", the independent variable of our data  (in this case, the transmission type)
coef(summary(fit))[4] # The standard error of the slope
``` 
A coefficient will be within 2 standard errors of its estimate about 95% of the time. This means the slope of our regression is between:
```{r}
coef(summary(fit))[2] + c(-1,1) * (2*coef(summary(fit))[4])
```

Normalizing the variables in the slope
```{r}
am_n <- (am - mean(am))/sd(am)
mpg_n <- (mpg - mean(mpg))/sd(mpg)
fit_n <- lm(mpg_n ~ am_n)
coef(fit_n)[2]
```

To be sure in the slope coefficient, calculate we are centering the data
```{r}
am_c <- (am - mean(am))
mpg_c <- (mpg - mean(mpg))
fit_c <- lm(mpg_c ~ am_c - 1) #forces a regression line to go through the origin (0, 0)
coef(fit_c)[1]
```
The slope coefficient is the same.




We can fit the regression line with the confidence interval around on the plot
```{r}
# 
# constructs table for different combination of parent-child height
freqData <- NULL
freqData <- as.data.frame(table(mpg, am))
#names(freqData) <- c("mpg", "am", "freq")
# convert to numeric values
freqData$mpg <- as.numeric(as.character(freqData$mpg))
freqData$am <- as.numeric(as.character(freqData$am))

g <- NULL
g <- ggplot(freqData[which(freqData$freq > 0),], aes(x = am, y = mpg))
g <- g + scale_size(range = c(2, 20), guide = "none" )
g <- g + geom_point(colour="gray50", aes(size = freq+10, show_guide = FALSE))
g <- g + geom_point(aes(colour=freq, size = freq))
g <- g + scale_colour_gradient(low = "lightblue", high="blue")

g <- g + geom_smooth(method="lm", formula=y~x)
g
```
This plot shows us the regression line between the factors with the confidence interval and dependency between [mpg] and [transmission type] values grouped by frequency.

Result: As we can see using an automatic transmission increases the amount of miles per gallon. We can say in average a manual transmission decreases the amount of miles of gallon by the slope coefficient (~`r as.double(round(coef(fit)[2],2))` miles per gallon) +/- double standart error (95% interval = 2 \* `as.double(round(coef(summary(fit))[4],2))` = `as.double(round(coef(summary(fit))[4],2)) * 2` miles per gallon).
